Tensorlint
==========

Experimental python linter to check for correctness of tensor/matrix/arrays operations
used by different libraries.

Currently it does nothing useful. Come back when it does something ;)

It's time people to move on! Python 2 is an amazing tool, but it's already several years
old, and soon it will deprecated.
