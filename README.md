Tensorlint
==========

Experimental python linter to check for correctness of tensor/matrix/arrays operations
used by different libraries.

Currently it does nothing useful. Come back when it does something ;)

Why is this all written in python 3.6
-------------------------------------

It's time people to move on! Python 2 is an amazing tool, but it's already several years
old, and soon it will deprecated.

Development
-----------

Create and enter enviroment:

    python3 -m venv venv-env3
    source venv-env3/bin/activate

Install requirements:

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip install argparse

Run tests
---------

    paver test_all

We use [hypothesis](hypothesis) for property-based testing. If you want to see the
statistics of the tests generated by hypothesis run:

    paver test --hypothesis-show-statistics

[hypothesis]: https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/
