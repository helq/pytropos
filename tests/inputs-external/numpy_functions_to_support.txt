Basic functions of numpy:
[x] basic + - * / // %  (broadcasting)
[x] array  (create an array out of lists, tuples, ints, and other arrays)

functions that preserve the shape (not as method in 'ndarray'):
[x] abs
[x] arcos
[x] arcosh
[x] arcsin
[x] arcsinh
[x] arctan
[x] arctanh
[x] cos
[x] floor
[x] zeros_like

Attrs that have same args and produce the same array as 'ndarray':
[x] zeros
[x] ones
[x] empty
[x] arange

Attrs and functions that should be implemented for NdArray (and as functions of the module (ie, np.shape(arr))):
[x] shape
[x] size
[x] ndim
[x] dot
[x] astype  (not as module function)
[x] T       (not as module function)












FUTURE: Attrs and functions to implement in the future:

[ ] subscript access (not slicing :S)
[ ] transpose
[ ] concatenate  (not as module function)
[ ] append       (not as module function)
[ ] add          (not as module function)
[ ] flatten
[ ] sum
[ ] prod
[ ] eye          (not as module function)
[ ] dtype   (the module function is a different thing)
